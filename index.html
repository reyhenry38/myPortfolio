					<p>Sweet, you’ve written a few sentences geared toward your ideal audience. Now what? Many people begin by talking all about themselves, when in actuality, your potential readers are more interested in learning about how your site is going to benefit or interest them. Before you get into your personal bio, try to answer these questions</p>
